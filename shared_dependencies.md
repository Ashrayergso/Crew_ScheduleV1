Shared dependencies across the files include:

1. **Data Models**: The Django models `CrewMember`, `Cert`, `Qualification`, `Ship`, `Positions`, `Assignment`, and `ShipCrewAllowance` are shared across the models.py, views.py, and admin.py files. They are also used in the templates for rendering data.

2. **Function Names**: The function `assignCrewToShips` is a core feature of the application and will be used in views.py and potentially in scripts.js for AJAX calls.

3. **URL Names**: URL names defined in urls.py are used in views.py for redirecting and in templates for creating links.

4. **Message Names**: The message names "CREW_FETCH_SUCCESS", "SHIP_FETCH_SUCCESS", "ASSIGNMENT_SUCCESS", and "ASSIGNMENT_FAILURE" are used in views.py to display messages and in templates to render these messages.

5. **DOM Element IDs**: The templates will contain various DOM elements with unique IDs that JavaScript functions in scripts.js will use for interactivity. These IDs are shared between the HTML templates and the JavaScript file.

6. **CSS Classes**: CSS classes defined in styles.css are used in the HTML templates for styling.

7. **Settings**: The settings defined in settings.py are used across the application, including in manage.py, wsgi.py, and asgi.py.
