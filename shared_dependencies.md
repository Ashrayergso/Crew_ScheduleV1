Shared dependencies across the files include:

1. **Data Models:** `CrewMember`, `Cert`, `Qualification`, `Ship`, `Positions`, `Assignment`, `ShipCrewAllowance`. These models are used across multiple files such as `models.py`, `views.py`, `admin.py`, and `tests.py`.

2. **Function Names:** `assignCrewToShips` is a core function that will be used in `views.py` and potentially in `tests.py`.

3. **URL Names:** URL names defined in `urls.py` will be used in `views.py` and the Django templates for linking and navigation.

4. **Template Names:** Django templates such as `base.html`, `crewmember_list.html`, `crewmember_detail.html`, `ship_list.html`, `ship_detail.html`, `assignment_list.html`, `assignment_detail.html` are used in `views.py` for rendering.

5. **Static Files:** `styles.css` and `script.js` are used in the Django templates for styling and interactivity.

6. **Message Names:** "CREW_FETCH_SUCCESS", "SHIP_FETCH_SUCCESS", "ASSIGNMENT_SUCCESS", "ASSIGNMENT_FAILURE" are used in `views.py` and Django templates for user notifications.

7. **Settings:** Django settings defined in `settings.py` are used in `manage.py`, `wsgi.py`, and potentially in other files for configuration.

8. **DOM Element IDs:** While not explicitly mentioned, any DOM element IDs used in the JavaScript file (`script.js`) would need to match those in the corresponding Django templates.

9. **Database Queries:** Queries like `Ship Open Positions Query`, `Next Available Crew Query`, `Crew Scheduling Report Query` are likely to be used in `views.py` and `models.py`.

10. **App Name:** The app name `crew_assignment_app` is used in Django settings and across multiple files for configuration and linking.
